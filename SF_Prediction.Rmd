## R Markdown

```{r data}
library("readxl")
d_start <- read.csv("/Users/estellepfitzer/Desktop/PB_Downloads/01-Aug2023/Merged_01-Aug2023.csv")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
